# Multilingual Sentence Tokenizer

A Python package for tokenizing multilingual documents at the sentence level. Users will provide a document to be segmented and the language of the document as input. Currently, there are supports for 41 languages ranging from low to high resource, which belong to 10 different language families (_i.e._ Afro-Asiatic, Indo-European, Sino-Tibetan, Austronesian, Japanese, Altaic, Dravidian, Tai-Kadai, Austro-Asiatic, and Niger-Congo). mSentsTokenizer matches the input language with the available supports of language from the pre-existing packages and simply invokes the corresponding package to tokenize the input document. Finally, this will return a list of sentences as the output.

### Default usage
* Sample input:
```python
from mSentsTokenizer import sentence_tokenizer
#text (str): text to split into sentence
#lang (str): ISO 639-2 language code
sentence_tokenizer.tokenize(text='''Newton took space to be more than relations between material objects and based his position on observation and experimentation. For a relationist there can be no real difference between inertial motion, in which the object travels with constant velocity, and non-inertial motion, in which the velocity changes with time, since all spatial measurements are relative to other objects and their motions.''', language='en')
```
* Sample output:
```
['Newton took space to be more than relations between material objects and based his position on observation and experimentation.',
 'For a relationist there can be no real difference between inertial motion, in which the object travels with constant velocity, and non-inertial motion, in which the velocity changes with time, since all spatial measurements are relative to other objects and their motions.']
